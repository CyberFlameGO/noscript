# NoScript Security Suite [![Badge License]][License]

The __NoScript Security Suite__ is Free Open Source Software (FOSS) providing extra protection for Firefox (on Android, too!), Chrome, Edge, Brave and other web browsers.

More information on [the NoScript web site](https://noscript.net)

#### Security reports


Winner of the "PC World World Class Award" and bundled with the Tor Browser, NoScript gives you with the best available protection on the web.

It allows JavaScript, Flash, Java and other executable content to run only from trusted domains of your choice, e.g. your home-banking site, mitigating remotely exploitable vulnerabilities including Spectre and Meltdown.

It  protects your "trust boundaries" against cross-site scripting attacks (XSS), cross-zone DNS rebinding / CSRF attacks (router hacking), and Clickjacking attempts, thanks to its unique ClearClick technology.

Such a preemptive approach  prevents exploitation of security vulnerabilities (known and even unknown!) with no loss of functionality where you need it.
Experts do agree: Firefox is really safer with NoScript ;-)
